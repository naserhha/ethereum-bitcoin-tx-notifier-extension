      <h2>Security & Privacy</h2>
      <p><strong>Your Security, Our Priority</strong></p>
      <p>We understand that when it comes to cryptocurrency, <b>security and privacy are not optional—they are essential</b>. This extension is designed from the ground up with your protection in mind. Here’s how we safeguard your data and your peace of mind:</p>
      <ul style="text-align:left; display:inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px;">
        <li><b>Local-Only Data Storage:</b> All your sensitive information—including wallet addresses and API keys—is stored exclusively in your browser’s local storage. No data is ever sent to any external server, third-party service, or cloud provider. Even if you uninstall the extension, your data remains private and is not recoverable by anyone else.</li>
        <li><b>No Tracking, No Analytics:</b> We do not use any analytics, tracking scripts, or advertising networks. Your usage patterns, addresses, and activity are never monitored, logged, or shared.</li>
        <li><b>Secure Communication:</b> All API requests (e.g., to Etherscan or Blockstream) are made directly from your browser using secure HTTPS connections. No proxy servers or intermediaries are involved, ensuring your requests are private and tamper-proof.</li>
        <li><b>Open Source & Transparent:</b> The entire source code of this extension is open and available on GitHub. You (or any security expert) can review, audit, and verify exactly how your data is handled. No hidden scripts, no obfuscation, no surprises.</li>
        <li><b>No Permissions Beyond What’s Needed:</b> The extension only requests the minimum permissions required to function. No access to your browsing history, cookies, or other sensitive browser data.</li>
        <li><b>Your API Keys Stay Private:</b> Your Etherscan API key is only used locally to fetch your Ethereum transactions. It is never sent to any server except the official Etherscan API, and only from your own browser.</li>
        <li><b>No Ads, No Profiling:</b> You will never see ads, popups, or sponsored content in this extension. We do not build any profile of you or your activity.</li>
        <li><b>You Are In Control:</b> You can clear all your data at any time from the extension’s settings. You can disable monitoring for any blockchain whenever you wish.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or security concerns, please <a href="github.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact the developer</a> or open an issue on our <a href="github.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a>.<br><strong>Your trust is our most valuable asset.</strong></p>
      <p style="margin-top:2em;"><b>Summary:</b><br>This extension is built for maximum privacy and security. Your data stays with you—always.</p>
